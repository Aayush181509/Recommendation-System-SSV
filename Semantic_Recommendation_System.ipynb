              "    'text': \"Baby Nursery Essentials\\n\\nPlanning a nursery is a lot of work, and while most moms-and-dads-to-be get caught up in the decor details, it’s important to double-check that you’ve got the basics. From cribs to changing tables to curtains and baby monitors, we’ve rounded up a list of all the must-have baby essentials you’ll want to have ready for your little one’s nursery. They’re sure to make those upcoming days (and nights) a whole lot easier.\\n\\n1. Crib\\n\\nBaby crib and crib mattress or bedding\\n\\nOne of the most important baby nursery essentials is the baby’s bed. Whether you choose an elaborate crib or a simple bassinet, your little one’s sleeping spot will likely be the focal point of the nursery. You want to make sure the crib you choose is safe, reliable, good quality, and will last you for a while to get your money’s worth. When you are purchasing sheets you want to make sure they are fitted sheets. That way they will stay in place. I would recommend buying at least three fitted sheets to make sure you got your baby's basics covered.\\n\\n2. Changing Table\\n\\nChanging Table for baby nursery\\n\\nThere are going to be thousands of dirty diapers in your baby’s first year. While you will become skilled at changing these diapers on the fly, it’s always a good idea to have an organized, stationary changing table in a baby’s nursery. Changing tables come in many varieties, some with shelves for organizing diapers and other must-haves, such as wipes and ointments. Most changing tables also feature a comfortable pad to lay the baby on.\\n\\n3. Blackout Curtains\\n\\nBlackout curtain for baby\\n\\nHelp baby gets a restful night’s sleep — and an afternoon nap — with these adorable 95-inch-long, machine-washable cloud-print blackout curtains. The smallest bit of light can be distracting for some babies, so blacking out daylight can be a nursery naptime lifesaver. The stars on the curtains also twinkle in the dark.\\n\\n4. Rocking Chair\\n\\nRocking Chair for MOM- Baby time\\n\\nA comfortable rocking chair or glider for parents to sit in while feeding and rocking their baby to sleep is very helpful. Babies are soothed by the rocking motion offered by chairs and gliders, and these chairs also offer a comfortable spot for breastfeeding. Even, the mothers can also feel relaxed while feeding and playing with their babies on this chair.\\n\\n5. Nursery Rug\\n\\nNursery rug for baby crawling and playing\\n\\nGive baby somewhere soft to crawl and play! Nursery rug is made of 100 percent wool, which makes it a great, natural place for baby to rest and roll around without any worries of floor germs.\\n\\n6. Muslin Blanket\\n\\nBaby in Muslin Blanket\\n\\nNo matter warm it is, we don’t think to fall asleep without some form of blanket or sheet over me. Most babies are the same. Muslin cloths can sometimes be just enough other blankets to put over your baby during the summer months while they’re in the pram to feel like they’re covered without overheating. Large muslin cloths can make an excellent lightweight swaddle for your newborn baby.\\n\\n7. Baby Monitor\\n\\nBaby Monitor for nursery\\n\\nIt’s hard for new parents to rest easy in a separate room from their baby. Baby monitors allow parents to be in constant audio or visual contact with their child, which is why they are top essentials for most parents. While traditional audio-only baby monitors are sufficient for many moms and dads, others prefer to purchase video monitors so that they can hear and see their baby throughout the day and night.\\n\\n8. White Noise Night Light\\n\\nWhite Noise Night Light for babies\\n\\nWith a night light in the room, your baby will never be in complete darkness which can be soothing. It will also help you to navigate through the room during the night without having to turn the room light on and risking to wake your baby up.\\n\\nYou can get classic night lights or special ones for babies that show stars on the ceiling.\\n\\n9. Humidifier\\n\\nHumidifier for baby nursery\\n\\nA humidifier is a baby essential and the best way to keep a baby breathing easy in cool, dry weather. Various Humidifier has an automatic shut-off, a 12-hour timer setting, and easy touch control operation.\\n\\n10. Baby Swing or Bouncer\\n\\nBaby Swing or Bouncer\\n\\nBaby bouncers is a great way to keep your baby busy and enjoying. It cradles your baby better than a crib mattress does, and its rocking or vibrating movements can mimic the motion of Mom’s body. Like cribs, baby swing or bouncer also have mobile for baby playing. You can also take these baby bouncers with you while going out with the baby in the car.\\n\\nOne safety note: Be sure your baby is securely strapped into his bouncer and never let him alone when he’s in it.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\nSetting up your baby’s nursery is super fun if you know what you need. Start with these ten nursery essentials and you’ll be well on your way to having everything ready for your baby.

              "    'text': 'We are sure that you already know a lot about your dearest baby — their habits, preferences, and likings. Nevertheless, babies are indeed born to surprise, and the astonishing baby facts we prepared only prove babies are really the most remarkable little things in the world.\\n\\n1. No Kneecaps\\n\\nYou may be surprised to learn that babies are born without kneecaps. Instead, newborns have cartilage which resembles a kneecap with its structure. These cartilages don’t develop until babies become six months that’s why most babies crawl on their arms instead of all four.\\n\\n2. Newborn Babies Do Not Cry\\n\\nHard to believe? But that’s true! They scream and howl if they need something but they don’t shed tears. Babies will not cry for about three weeks after birth because their tear ducts aren’t entirely developed. They only produce enough moisture to keep baby’s eyes healthy but not tears.\\n\\n3. Most Babies Are Born With Blue Eyes\\n\\nDon’t be surprised if the colour of your baby’s eyes doesn’t resemble the colour of your eyes, or your partner’s. That’s another surprising baby fact!\\n\\nThe colour of the eye comes from the colour particles behind the iris. In most cases, the pigment of those particles isn’t developed at birth. That’s why most babies regardless of their genetics are born with blue eyes. By ten months the colour of the eyes will most likely change to green, hazel or brown.\\n\\n4. Babies Constantly Feel Sleepy\\n\\nNewborns feel sleepy almost all the time. During the first few months, they are alert for just ten minutes in every hour of the day. This happens because the baby’s brain uses the biggest part of the total body glucose supply, which makes babies feel sleepy.\\n\\n5. First Smile\\n\\nAnother fact you may want to know about your baby is that they will be able to smile back to you only after they are a month old. In this period, you may try to engage your little one with funny facial expression or voice and see if they are ready to give you the first smile.\\n\\n6. Hair Falls Out\\n\\nIf your baby has thick hair at birth, it doesn’t mean that it will stay the same. Usually, the baby’s hair falls out in the first few weeks and then grows back over the next year.\\n\\n7. Your Baby Puts Things to Mouth\\n\\nWe’re all aware of this baby fact and unsuccessfully try to fight against the baby’s innate desire to put everything in their mouth. Babies use their sense of touch to explore things around them. The most sensitive touch receptors are in and around their mouth, which is why they try to chew everything which attracts their attention.\\n\\n8. Newborns Have Great Hearing\\n\\nThat starts in the womb when babies are already capable to recognize the music they hear. Hence, you may play the song you used to hear during the pregnancy, to soothe your small one when they’re whimsical. Straight after the birth, the baby’s hearing is not perfect as the middle ear is still full of fluid but they already may recognize their mother’s voice from just one syllable. You may also consider using white noise as a sleeping aid during those first few months.\\n\\n9. Babies Laugh More Than Adults\\n\\nThis baby fact proves that our little ones feel happier than we do! They laugh on average 300 times a day while adults laugh only 60 times. Of course, that’s only after they learn how to do that.\\n\\n10. Your Baby Can Swim\\n\\nBabies are born with the natural ability to swim and hold their breath under the water. They can even splash around with their arms and legs imitating the swimming. If you take your baby to a swimming class you will see these innate talents in action.\\n\\n11. Newborns Can Swallow And Breathe Simultaneously\\n\\nHow you ever wondered how your baby can eat from a bottle without stopping? That’s because they can swallow and breathe at the same time until seven months. Babies also take much more breathes than adults.\\n\\n12. Your Baby Can Communicate\\n\\nEven before your baby starts speaking you may contribute to their communicative skills. The little ones can communicate using gestures like waving, clapping and pointing. And you should use the opportunity to interact with your baby and teach them something new. The studies have shown that this will improve their verbal communication in the future.\\n\\nThose are just a few surprising baby facts but your parenting journey will for sure be full of own fascinating moments and amazing adventures together with your little one.',\n",

              "    'text': 'It’s not you, it’s definitely me. But it’s true. I can’t care that you’re pregnant.\\n\\nDon’t get me wrong. I know, I’m basically a monster. Babies (and the mere prospect of) should spark joy in anyone with a fucking ounce of humanity, right? What about those happy, elated squeals you hear from my side of the phone? That must be excitement. Sure, that sounds like me, but that’s just my avatar. She’s way nicer than I am… and utterly full of shit.\\n\\nThere are approximately 7.8 billion reasons why the prospect of one more human is less than appealing. The entire West Coast of the US is on fire and our planet is literally dying. Pandemic ate up 2020 and took alot of people with it. Black people are STILL trying to convince this country that their lives just fucking MATTER. We are driving species to extinction every day… children are STILL in cages… Social media is dismantling the fabric of our society… and two people just today casually mentioned the pending Civil War as a potential disruption for Thanksgiving travel…. Someone please stop me before I spontaneously combust.\\n\\nSo yeah. Let’s get back to the topic of your procreation.\\n\\nAll of the above are valid points, right? You’d have to be insane to bring a new life into this dumpster fire existence of ours, right?\\n\\nWant to know a secret? The “justice warrior, savior of the planet” excuse may be super on brand right now… but it’s not the truth.\\n\\nI can’t care because if I do, I have to face reality. It’s because I am fucking terrified. I am terrified of it all. Every single element of pregnancy, birthing and motherhood is paralyzingly scary.\\n\\nI look at you, future mama, and I am in awe of your bravery. I could not do what you do. It makes me feel like a broken person. The feminist in me wants to tear my own hair out at the mere implication of that, but it’s true. I am petrified, paralyzingly petrified. It doesn’t feel like an option for me because I feel sure that I would fail, whatever that even means.\\n\\nAnd beautiful future mama, it’s selfish, I know. I am taking your miracle and turning it around to make myself feel justified in my choices. I am a coward.\\n\\nAnother confession: I was pregnant once, not long ago. I made a decision that I do not regret. Still, a decision that lingers.\\n\\nSo forgive me future mama, as I said, it’s definitely me, not you.',\n",
